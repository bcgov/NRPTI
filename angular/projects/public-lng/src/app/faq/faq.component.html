            Major industry projects require provincial approval and the appropriate permits before development can move
            forward. This site provides context and access to the multiple layers of authorizations, compliance updates
            and other items that represent the provincial government’s role as it relates to LNG regulation and
            oversight.

            This site provides specifics about the provincial government’s role. There are multiple layers of
            authorizations and approvals the industry must also obtain from the federal government, including a licence
            to export natural gas overseas.

            LNG Canada represents the first large-scale export project to announce a final investment decision – an
            industry term confirming a proposed project is moving forward. The Coastal GasLink pipeline will be built to
            supply natural gas to the export facility.

            Now that construction is underway, provincial oversight ensures each project is compliant with all

          <i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i>LNG projects will source natural gas from northeast British
          Columbia – how is that aspect of the industry regulated?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Natural gas extraction activities, also known as upstream development, is regulated by the BC Oil and Gas
            Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BC Oil and Gas Commission is an independent, single-window regulator for the natural gas industry,
            overseeing the lifecycle of every project, including exploration, development, consultation, pipeline
            transportation and reclamation.
          </p>
          <p>
            All permitting and oversight authorities are delegated to the BC Oil and Gas Commission through the
            <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/08036_01">Oil and Gas Activities Act</a> –
            British Columbia’s regulatory framework for all oil and gas activities in the province.
          </p>
          <p>More details about the Commission can be found at <a href="https://www.bcogc.ca/">www.bcogc.ca</a>.</p>

          <i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i>How are workforce accommodations regulated?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>There are multiple government agencies involved with regulating workforce accommodations.</p>
          <p>
            It starts with the environmental assessment process that assesses environmental, economic, health,
            cultural/heritage and social effects – and that includes workforce accommodations. Conditions can be imposed
            on a project’s environmental assessment certificate to add specific regulatory requirements related to the
            workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BC Oil and Gas Commission permits the use of Crown Land where the accommodations are built. Northern
            Health approves construction, food services, drinking water and other necessities. Local governments have a
            role too by providing permits linked to the BC Building Code – provincial regulation that governs how new
            constructions are completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other agencies with a role can include the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Ministry of
            Transportation, Technical Safety BC, and WorkSafeBC.

          <i class="material-icons">chevron_right</i>Will Coastal GasLink’s pipeline transport oil or other products?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The pipeline will only transport natural gas. In fact, pipelines built to supply natural gas to an LNG
            facility in British Columbia can not be converted or permitted to transport other products, including oil
            and bitumen.
